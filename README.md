# Path_based_adventure_game
Using texts in nested loop concepts to construct a basic choice-based game. 


Welcome to a text-based adventure game designed to test your decision-making skills and lead you through an interactive story.

## Introduction

This game is filled with choices that will determine your fate. Each decision you make will impact the outcome, so choose wisely and see where the adventure takes you!

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. Enter your name when prompted to personalize your experience.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate the story.  (The story can be different depending on how you are building it)
4. Make choices by typing the options provided and see the consequences unfold.

## Example/Represented Game Scenario

You find yourself on a dirt road with two paths ahead: left and right. Each path presents unique challenges and opportunities, leading to different endings based on your decisions.

- **Left Path:** You encounter a river. Will you swim across or walk around?
- **Right Path:** A bridge appears. Do you risk crossing it or turn back?

Every choice influences the narrative, leading to various outcomes ranging from triumph to failure. Python's conditional statements drive the game's structure, offering an engaging and dynamic experience.
